## Shiny: What is it and Use Cases

<div class="column-left">
- R Pacakge that allows you to easily build interactive web apps straight from R
- Several ways to host stand alone applications 
- Several ways to expand application features using htmlwidgets, shinyjs, and, CSS themes
</div>

<div class="column-left">

Some common use cases for our clients:

- Automating manual cleansing and manipulation done in excel 
    + Could even include querying a users internal database provided their credential
- Data Visualization
- Getting models into users hands
    + User can upload data, cleansing and calling of predict can occur in the background, and then user can download model results

</div>

## Shiny: What is it and Use Cases 

<iframe src = "https://shiny.rstudio.com/", style = "width:900px; height:700px"></iframe>

## Shiny: What is it and Use Cases 

##### Automating manual cleansing and manipulation done in excel 

<div class="column-left">
- User would spend a few hours a week cleansing raw data from internal SQL database in excel to generate reports on key metrics (i.e., pivot tables, aggregating, rolling averages, historical comparisons)
- All cleaning previously done in excel programmed in R
- User could then query database every week within Shiny application, click "cleanse" which triggered cleaning code, and then download results
- Packages Used
    + DT, openxlsx, shinydashboard,plyr,dplyr,lubridate,RODBC, zoo
- Key R Functions: 
    + fileInput, textInput, actionButton, reactive, sqlQuery, downloadButton
</div>

<div class="column-left">

Shiny App for Automation
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE,out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ksasso/Dropbox/R/Rladies/electron_meet_shiny_6.14.18/automation_shinyapp_example.png")
```
</div>

## Shiny: What is it and Use Cases 

##### Getting models into users hands quickly 

<div class="column-left">

- Users wanted to better predict risk of large IT project portfolios (i.e., going over budget, utilizing greater than expected time or resources)
- Built a model in XGBoost. User wanted to run model monthly to test it out 
- Model deployment in a corporation could take months to years
- Used Electron to package: trained model object, cleansing required, predict function to apply model, download/upload for new runs and results
- Packages Used
    + dplyr,tidyr,ggplot2,Matrix,xgboost,openxlsx,scales,shiny,shinydashboard
- Key R Functions: 
    + fileInput, textInput, actionButton, reactive,downloadButton, selectizeInput, renderPlot
</div>

<div class="column-left">
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE,out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ksasso/Dropbox/R/Rladies/electron_meet_shiny_6.14.18/model_shinyapp.png")
```
</div>

## Shiny App Example

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("region", "Region:", 
                choices = colnames(WorldPhones)),
    plotOutput("phonePlot")
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
      barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
              ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
    })
  },
  
  options = list(height = 500)
)
```

## Shiny App Deployment Options

<iframe src = "https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/", style = "width:900px; height:700px"></iframe>

## What is Electron?

<div class="column-left">
**Electron**

- Electron is a chromium web browswer and a nodeJS runtime brought together in a beautiful harmony to allow us to build client applications on any platform using web technologies
- Allow users to create native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and ofcourse, Shiny!
- Same technology messager application "Slack" is packaged in
- Can use this as a window to shiny applications 
    + Instance of a browser window in electron 
</div>

<div class="column-left">

**Electron and RPortable**

- Collaboratory team made the code changes necessary to include ![RPortable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/) within Electron
- Limitation: RPortable currently only supported for Windows
- New Packages installed within R (within electron)
</div>

## What is Electron  

<iframe src = "https://electronjs.org/", style = "width:900px; height:700px"></iframe>


## How Do I use Electron to deploy a ShinyApp?

![Everything you need is on the Collaboratory's public GitHub Repo!](https://github.com/ColumbusCollaboratory/electron-quick-start)

## Electron environment vs. traditional deployment options

**Key Differences**

## Resources

![Many Tutorials on RStudio Website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/):

- Some personal favorite sections include the Get Started Video Tutorials, The Gallery, and several of the Articles on Special issues. 
    + Some of the most frequently used special issues for me included Dashboards, Reacitivty, and Inputs/Outputs

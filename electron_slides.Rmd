## We know Shiny, but what is Electron?

<div class="column-left">

**Electron**

- Electron is a chromium web browser and a Node.js runtime brought together to allow us to build thick client applications on any platform using web technologies
- Allow users to create native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and ofcourse, Shiny!
- Skype, Atom, Slack, and many other Apps built on Electron
- Chromium and Node.js together launch an instance of a browser window in electron 

</div>

<div class="column-left">
**Electron, R, and RPortable**

- Collaboratory team made the code changes necessary to include [RPortable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/) within Electron
    + We packaged up R alongside Node.js and Chromium 
    + We then reference R based on its relative path
    
</div>

## We know Shiny, but what is Electron?

[ElectronJS](https://electronjs.org/)

## How do Electron & Shiny work together? 

##### Electron, R, and RPortable  

```{js}
var appPath = path.join(app.getAppPath(), "app.R" )
var execPath = "RScript"
if(process.platform == WINDOWS){
  killStr = "taskkill /im Rscript.exe /f"
  appPath = appPath.replace(/\\/g, "\\\\");
  execPath = path.join(app.getAppPath(), "R-Portable-Win", "bin", "RScript.exe" )
} else if(process.platform == MACOS){
  //killStr = 'pkill -9 "R"'
  execPath = path.join(app.getAppPath(), "R-Portable-Mac", "bin", "Rscript" )
} else {
  console.log("not on windows or macos?")
  throw new Error("not on windows or macos?")
}
``` 

## How do Electron & Shiny work together? 

##### Node.js, Chromium, and thick client applications

<div class="column-left">
- Thick Client Apps
    + Provide functionality independent of the central server
    + Run both the user interfcace and server logic on your computer 
- Node.js
    + Main, server side process. 
    + We use Node.js main process to launch the shiny app by redirecting the rendered content to be the URL that the shinyApp is running on (i.e., my home IP address and default port)
  
</div>

<div class="column-left">
- Chromium
    + Web broweser - the key to the user-interface
    + Provides a window to the shinyApp
    + We call the shinyApp function just like you would in RStudio and then direct chormium to our local port where shiny is running
    
</div>

##  Electron vs. Other deployment options

<div class="column-left">

- Deploy to the cloud: Shinyapps.io
    + Deploy up to 5 apps 25 active hours, for free. 
    + User authentication starting at $99/month
    + No hardware, installation or contract requried
    + Requires sending data to the cloud
- Deploy on-premises: Shiny Server
    + Deployed behind your firewall
    + Enterprise grade scaling, security and admin features
    + IT involvment: you install it and you manage it

</div>

<div class="column-left">

- Deploy on-premises Commercial: Shiny Server Pro
    + Deploy shinyApp behind a firewall
    + IT involvment required and only supported on Linux
    + Increased access controls i(i.e., SSL, LDAP, Active Directory)
- Deploy on-premises Commercial: RStudio Connect
    + Added capabilities including in-org publishing and scheduling of multiple content types
- Creative option: Docker Containers
    + Stil requires heavy IT involvement to set up initial docker environment

</div>

## How can I use Electron to deploy a basic ShinyApp?

## Intermediate Use Case

##### Real World Example: Automating manual cleansing and manipulation done in excel 

<div class="column-left">

- All cleaning previously done in excel programmed in R
- User could then query database every week within Shiny application and then download results (how did that work?)
- Packages Used
    + DT, openxlsx, shinydashboard, plyr, dplyr, lubridate, RODBC, zoo
- Key R Functions: 
    + fileInput, textInput, actionButton, reactive, sqlQuery, downloadButton
- Special adjustments
    + On Windows: Rtools (for windows) and REnviron.site modifiction
    + REnviro.site file PATH="${PATH};${R_HOME}\Rtools\bin
    + On Both: Download new packages 
    
</div>

<div class="column-left">

Shiny App for Automation
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE,out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ksasso/Dropbox/R/Rladies/electron_meet_shiny_6.14.18/automation_shinyapp_example.png")
```
</div>

## Intermediate Use Case: New Shiny app.R

## Intermediate Use Case: New Packages

## Intermediate Use Case

<div class="column-left">
##### Real World Example: Getting a model into users hands quickly

- Users wanted to better predict risk of large IT project portfolios 
- Built a model in XGBoost. User wanted to run model monthly to test it out 
- Used Electron to package: trained model object, cleansing required, predict function to apply model, download/upload for new runs and results
- Packages Used:
    + dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, Matrix, xgboost, openxlsx, scales, shiny, shinydashboard
- Key R Functions: 
    + fileInput, textInput, actionButton, reactive,downloadButton, selectizeInput, renderPlot
- Special adjustments
    + Data stripped from XGBoost train object
    
</div>

<div class="column-left">
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE,out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/ksasso/Dropbox/R/Rladies/electron_meet_shiny_6.14.18/model_shinyapp.png")
```
</div>

## Additional Considerations & Resources

<div class="column-left">

- Application size
    + Stripping particularly large dependencies (i.e., BH package)
</div>

<div class="column-left">

- [Many Tutorials on RStudio Website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/):
    + Some personal favorite sections include the Get Started Video Tutorials, The Gallery, and several of the Articles on Special issues. 
    + Some of the most frequently used special issues for me included Dashboards, Reacitivty, and Inputs/Outputs

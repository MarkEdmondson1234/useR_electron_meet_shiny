Navigate to our Sharepoint folder, here , to find the "ShinyApp.zip" file you will need. Download the ShinyApp.zip file and unzip. Let us know if you have problems accessing it. 

Once the file has been unzipped, just follow these steps to launch the test app:
  1.	Within the main "ShinyApp" folder, navigate to the following subdirectory: Build --> ShinyApp
2.	Double click on the "shinyApp" application file (highlighted in attached screenshot)
3.	Make sure you can see and interact with the shiny app as depicted in the second attachment. If you can, we have success! If you can't, open up task manager and make sure you only have one instance of the ShinyApp electron running. End tasks on them all if you have more than 1 and re try.
